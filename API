# API for the DB queries

## Output

All requests made to the query file will have a JSON output, which format
depends on the command input.

## Errors

If an error went to occur, the query file will return a JSON object in the
following format:
{
	'type': <error type>,
	'error': <error string>
}

## Arguments

Along with a command, you can supply additional arguments.
Supplying arguments if pretty straight forward in PHP, example:
?cmd=myCommand&argumentName=arguementValue

## Commands

### getCompanies

Wether you provide an additional argument or not, the output of the
getCompanies command will have the following format:
[
	{
		'id' : <id>,
		'name' : <name>,
		â€¦
	},
]

This array of companies will have different fields in each entry, depending on
the column names chosen in the database.

#### No argument
_Output_: every company in the database

#### byName
_Output_: every company whose name contains the given string (case insensitive)
_Input_: string to be searched in the companies name
